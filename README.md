**Veil of Ages: _Whispers of Kalixoria_** is a 2D necromancy kingdom simulation where you build a realm where the living and undead coexist. Set your character's priorities, manage their activities, and build a flourishing domain that defies conventional morality.

## üåô Vision

Lead a necromancer's journey from outcast to ruler, creating a unique society where undead serve alongside living citizens. Make meaningful moral choices that shape your character and kingdom without forced alignment. Will you be a benevolent scholar of death magic, a practical survivalist, or a dark overlord? The choice is yours.

While the initial focus is on necromancy, the game's architecture is designed to eventually support multiple faction types, including nature-focused druids, elemental mages, and more.

## üéÆ Current Features

- **Strategic Activity System**: Guide your character through an innovative priority-based activity queue rather than direct control, similar to RimWorld's work priorities but centered on a single protagonist
- **Dynamic Time System**: Experience a living world where time flows continuously, with speed controls from pause to ultra-fast time advancement
- **Undead Creation**: Command skeletons and zombies with distinct behaviors and needs
- **Living NPCs**: Citizens react dynamically to their environment with complex need systems
- **Simulation-Based Gameplay**: A deeply simulated world where entities act according to their own motivations even when not directly observed
- **Rich World Generation**: Procedurally generated settlements and environments

## üîÆ Planned Features

- **Autonomy Profiles**: Create customizable behavior patterns for your character, balancing research, kingdom management, and personal needs
- **Kingdom Management**: Construct and upgrade buildings, manage resources, research new technologies
- **Deep Character Development**: Progress through magical specializations with meaningful choices and realistic time investment
- **Montage Mode**: Skip ahead in time while your character advances their skills and your kingdom develops
- **Need Systems**: Complex hierarchies of needs for both living and undead entities that influence their behavior
- **Moral Choice Framework**: Shape your kingdom's philosophy through your actions

## üíª Technical Highlights

- **Activity-Priority System**: Sophisticated task management similar to Oxygen Not Included, but with deeper automation options
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Autonomous entities with rich behavior systems inspired by Dwarf Fortress's simulation depth
- **Multi-Threaded Simulation**: Performance-focused design handles large kingdoms with many active entities
- **Trait-Based Character System**: Modular components for complex entity behaviors
- **Time-Based Progression**: True skill development over realistic timeframes, encouraging use of time advancement mechanics
