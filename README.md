**Veil of Ages** is a 2D necromancy kingdom simulation where you build a realm where the living and undead coexist. 

## üåô Vision

Lead a necromancer's journey from outcast to ruler, creating a unique society where undead serve alongside living citizens. Make meaningful moral choices that shape your character and kingdom without forced alignment. Will you be a benevolent scholar of death magic, a practical survivalist, or a dark overlord? The choice is yours.

While the initial focus is on necromancy, the game's architecture is designed to eventually support multiple faction types, including nature-focused druids, elemental mages, and more.

## üéÆ Current Features

- **Player Character**: Control a necromancer in a reactive tile-based world
- **Undead Creation**: Command skeletons and zombies with distinct behaviors
- **Living NPCs**: Citizens from both your and other kingdoms with personalities that respond to their environment
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Hybrid system supporting both direct control and simulation
- **Dynamic World**: Procedurally generated settlements and environments

## üîÆ Planned Features

- **Modular Faction System**: Expand beyond necromancy with multiple magical paths
- **Kingdom Management**: Construct and upgrade buildings, manage resources, research
- **Deep Character Development**: Progress through magical specializations with meaningful choices
- **Rich Personality System**: Followers with distinct needs, desires, and relationships
- **Moral Choice Framework**: Shape your kingdom's philosophy through your actions

## üíª Technical Highlights

- **Performance-Focused Design**: Multi-threaded entity simulation to handle large kingdoms
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Autonomous entities with rich behavior systems
- **Trait-Based Character System**: Modular components for complex entity behaviors
- **Data-Driven Design**: Extensive configuration options for modding and expansion
