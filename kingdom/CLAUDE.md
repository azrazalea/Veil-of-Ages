# Kingdom Directory

## Purpose

This directory is a **placeholder** for the future Kingdom Management system. It will contain code for managing the player's growing kingdom/settlement.

## Current Status

**Empty** - Not yet implemented.

## Planned Features

Based on the project roadmap, this module will eventually include:

- **Resource Management**: Tracking and managing kingdom resources (food, materials, gold, etc.)
- **Population Management**: Tracking living and undead citizens
- **Building Management**: High-level building placement and upgrades
- **Economy System**: Trade, production chains, and resource flow
- **Territory Control**: Managing controlled areas and expansion
- **Faction Relations**: Diplomacy with other factions

## Dependencies

When implemented, this module will likely depend on:
- `/entities/building/` - For building definitions
- `/world/` - For territory and grid management
- `/entities/beings/` - For population tracking

## Implementation Notes

The project follows a phased development approach. Kingdom management is Phase 5, after:
1. Core Mechanics (complete)
2. Entity Framework (in progress)
3. Necromancy Systems (pending)
4. Personality Implementation (pending)
