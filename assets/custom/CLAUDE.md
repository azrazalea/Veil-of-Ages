# Custom Assets

## Purpose

Original pixel art assets created specifically for Veil of Ages. These are 32x32 sprites in the style of Urizen 1-bit but with expanded color palettes (typically 2 colors + black outline).

## Structure

Each asset has its own subdirectory containing:
- `<name>.png` — Final 32x32 sprite with transparency (game-ready)
- `grid.txt` — Source pixel grid for editing
- `palette.txt` — Color palette used by the sprite

## Creating/Editing Assets

Custom sprites are created and managed using [gridfab](https://github.com/azrazalea/gridfab), an open-source pixel art tool. See its documentation for usage instructions.

## Current Assets
