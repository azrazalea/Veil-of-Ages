## Modifications

The original spritesheet has been upscaled 2× using nearest-neighbor (point) interpolation. No artistic modifications were made. The original grid parameters (1px offset, 12×12 tiles, 1px spacing) scale to 2px offset, 24×24 tiles, 2px spacing.

## About

5,500+ tiles covering 40+ character races with 100+ professions, buildings, interiors, items, terrain, and multi-theme content (fantasy, modern, sci-fi, horror). Each tile uses exactly one non-black color chosen for maximum readability.
