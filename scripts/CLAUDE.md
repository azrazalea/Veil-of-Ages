# Scripts

## Purpose

Development utility scripts that are not part of the game itself.

## Files

### log_compactor.py
Python script that collapses duplicate log lines for easier reading. Useful when debugging entity AI loops that produce repetitive log output.

### atlas_browsing_tileset.tres
Godot TileSet resource for visually browsing sprite atlases in the editor. Not used by the game at runtime.
