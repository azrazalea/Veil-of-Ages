# Villager Entity Analysis

## Core Classes and Files
- `HumanTownsfolk.cs`: The villager entity class that inherits from `Being`
- `VillagerTrait.cs`: Main trait that controls villager behavior through a state machine
- `LivingTrait.cs`: Adds basic needs (currently only hunger)
- `ConsumptionBehaviorTrait.cs`: Manages hunger and food acquisition
- `Need.cs`: Base class for entity needs
- `BeingNeedsSystem.cs`: System that manages entity needs
- `FarmFoodStrategies.cs`: Strategies for finding and consuming food

## Current Villager Behavior
The villager currently has a simple state machine with three states:
- **IdleAtHome**: Stays at home with chance to go to square or buildings
- **IdleAtSquare**: Stays at village square with chance to go home
- **VisitingBuilding**: Visits random buildings then returns home

## Need System
- Only hunger is currently implemented
- Need values range from 0-100 (0=bad/starving, 100=good/full)
- Needs decay over time at a configurable rate
- Entities take actions to satisfy needs when they drop below thresholds

## Key Classes to Extend
- `Need.cs`: For implementing new need types
- `LivingTrait.cs`: For adding new needs to living beings
- `VillagerTrait.cs`: For enhancing the villager state machine and behavior
- Implementing new strategies (like `FarmFoodStrategies.cs`) for new needs

## Time System
There should be a time system (likely `GameTime.cs`), which needs to be investigated for integration with day/night cycles and daily schedules.

## Improvement Directions
1. Add more needs (sleep, social, comfort)
2. Implement daily schedules
3. Add personality traits
4. Create more complex social interactions
5. Implement building preferences
6. Add memory of experiences and relationships
