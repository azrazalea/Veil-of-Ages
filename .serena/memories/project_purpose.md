# Project Purpose

"Veil of Ages" is a 2D tile-based necromancer kingdom management game developed with Godot Engine 4.4.1 using C#. The game blends RPG character progression with base-building and strategic management, allowing players to create and manage a kingdom with both living and undead citizens.

## Core Design Principles
- The player character is a necromancer who is not necessarily evil, with meaningful moral choices throughout the game
- The game allows for living beings to coexist with undead, including regular citizens
- Focus on strategic kingdom/settlement management with base building elements
- The player character exists in the game world as an agent whose activities and priorities you manage
- Followers (both living and undead) have personalities, needs, and desires - not just mindless pawns
- Strategic map system for long-term planning

## Development Phases
The project follows a phased development approach:
1. Core Mechanics (grid/tile system, time system, activity-priority control)
2. Entity Framework (character stats, AI behaviors, needs systems)
3. Necromancy Systems (spell casting, undead creation/control)
4. Personality Implementation (trait-based attributes, needs, relationships)
5. Kingdom Management (resources, buildings, population)
6. Progression and Choices (leveling, moral decisions, consequences)
7. Multi-Faction Framework (for different playable factions)

## Unique Game Elements
- Activity-Priority Control System (instead of direct moment-to-moment control)
- Time System with configurable rates (from paused to ultra-fast)
- Mixed living/undead population management
- Trait-based personality system for all entities
- Complex needs systems for different entity types
