# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Committing Code
- [ ] Ensure code follows project naming conventions and style guidelines
- [ ] Check for nullable reference type safety (project has Nullable enabled)
- [ ] Verify threading safety for any code that might interact with the EntityThinkingSystem
- [ ] Add XML documentation for public classes, methods, and properties
- [ ] Make sure new code interfaces properly with existing systems
- [ ] Ensure any performance-critical code is optimized appropriately
- [ ] Check that new classes follow the established architecture patterns

## Testing Procedures
- [ ] Test new features in the Godot editor
- [ ] Verify that changes don't introduce performance issues in the entity simulation
- [ ] Check compatibility with the time system and tick-based simulation
- [ ] Test interactions between different entity types (if relevant)
- [ ] Verify that changes work correctly at different time scales

## Entity-Specific Considerations
- [ ] When adding new entities, ensure they implement all required interfaces
- [ ] Make sure entities interact properly with the perception system
- [ ] Verify that entities have appropriate needs based on their type
- [ ] Check that traits are properly initialized and function as expected
- [ ] Test entity behavior in the activity-priority control system

## Code Organization
- [ ] Place new files in the appropriate project directories
- [ ] Follow the established namespace structure
- [ ] Create appropriate abstraction layers for new functionality
- [ ] Consider how new features might be extended in future development phases

## Git Workflow
- [ ] Create feature branches for significant changes
- [ ] Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages
- [ ] Pull and merge the latest changes before submitting work
- [ ] Review changes using git diff before committing

## Special Considerations
- [ ] Remember that the game uses a custom Base-56 time system (56 seconds per minute, etc.)
- [ ] Keep in mind the threaded entity thinking system when designing entity interactions
- [ ] Consider the long-term development roadmap when implementing new features
- [ ] Ensure new code aligns with the game's design principles
